**Overall Important/Next Steps**

I should focus primarily on artificial intelligence work. There's lots
of interesting stuff throughout Computer Science, but AI is probably
where the most influential breakthroughs are.

* AI
    * CS188 and Neural Nets ourses.
* Books
    * Norvig, Murphy books.
    * Taming Text.
* Distributed
    * Redis book.
    * MongoDB, ElasticSearch.
    * Viewstamped Replciation/Virtual Synchrony.
* Math
    * PCA/SVD.
    * Quasi-Newton methods.
    * Discrete Fourier Transform
* Online Courses
    * Maybe Compilers course.
    * Fundamentals of EE course.

**Randoms**

* Implement Gaussian elimination.
* Implement Canny edge detection; Hough transform.
* Finish Aho compilers textbook!
* Maybe look at Elm/FRP. RxJS? Find a good book for this?
* Jeff Dean on ML: http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40565.html
* TensorFlow. GPU programming?
    * https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow/
    * Has a bunch of resources; including some good blog posts, and
      Google papers.
* CPU Architecture notes.
* Electricity.
* Zero-shot learning?
* Grover's algorithm.

## Statement

**Do not review all files!** The TODO directory files contain
everything I need to make priorities.
