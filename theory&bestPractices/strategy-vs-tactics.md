Strategy vs Tactics
===================

The difference between strategy and tactics: strategy is done above the shoulders, tactics are done below the shoulders. However, these two must work in tandem, without it your organization cannot efficiently achieve goals.  If you have strategy without tactics you have big thinkers and no action. If you have tactics without strategy, you have disorder.
Organizations need big wings (strategic thinking) and feet (capability to achieve).
