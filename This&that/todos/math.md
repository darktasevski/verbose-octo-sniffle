## Priority

* Finish Strang! Particularly: SVD, PCA.
* Quasi-Newton Methods for hill climbing. Line search, conjugate
  gradient descent. WTF does a symmetric matrix mean? Subgradient
  descent?
* Euler's identity. Fourier transform. FFT.

## Other

* OLS vs GLS, and what is the maximum likelihood estimate in each
  case? Heteroscedascity?
    * Another question: Errors-in-Variables models.
    * Most regression assumes regressors are errorless, and noise is
      added in observed variable.
    * That means noise is overwhelmed by signal as output value is
      increased.
* Lagrange, KKT and multiple equality constraints.
* Might be nice to have a sumary of Kolmogorov complexity again.
* WTF are variational methods?
* All this spectral graph theory I don't understand.
* Grover's Algorithm
