# Values & Types

Javascript has typed values, not typed variables.
-string
-number
-boolean
-null, undefined
-object
-symbol(ES6)

ex.
var a;
typeof a;				// "undefined"

a = "hello world";
typeof a;				// "string"

a = 42;
typeof a;				// "number"

a = true;
typeof a;				// "boolean"

a = null;
typeof a;				// "object" -- weird, bug

a = undefined;
typeof a;				// "undefined"

a = { b: "c" };
typeof a;				// "object"

typeof operator always returns one of six(seven as of ES6) strings.

typeof a means "type of VALUE in variable a", not "type of variable a"
because only VALUES have types in JS
variables are just containers for those values.

** typeof null is expected to return "null", but it errantly returns "object".
** this bug will not likely to be fixed.

a = undefined;

  is equivalent to

var a;

Object typed value has properties(named locations) that each hold their own
value of any type.

ex.
var obj = {
	a: "hello world",
	b: 42,
	c: true
};

obj.a;		// "hello world"
obj.b;		// 42
obj.c;		// true

obj["a"];	// "hello world"
obj["b"];	// 42
obj["c"];	// true

properties can either be accessed with dot notation or bracket notation(need
string inside or a variable.)

dot notation is prefered when possible, but bracket notation is needed if the
property name has special characters such as obj["hello world!"]

ex.

var obj = {
	a: "hello world",
	b: 42
};

var b = "a";

obj[b];			// "hello world"
obj["b"];		// 42

there are also two other value types: array and function. These are like
sub-type -- specialized versions of the object type.

An array is an object that hold values of any type in numerically indexed
positions

you could use array as a normal object with named properties or use object
as an array with numerically indexed properties, but it would be considered
improper.

array = numerically positioned values
object = named properties

other object subtype is function.

ex.

function foo() {
	return 42;
}

foo.bar = "hello world";

typeof foo;			// "function"
typeof foo();		// "number"
typeof foo.bar;		// "string"

you only use function object properties in limited cases(like foo.bar);

types
-number
-string
-boolean
-object
-null(typeof null is 'object'), undefined

subtypes(specilzied object)
-function
-array(typeof array is 'object')

these types and subtypes have behaviors exposed as properties and methods that
are quite powerful and useful.

ex.
var a = "hello world";
var b = 3.14159;

a.length;				// 11
a.toUpperCase();		// "HELLO WORLD"
b.toFixed(4);			// "3.1416"

primative values have corresponding object wrapper
string values have String obj
number values have Number obj
boolearn values have Boolean obj

these wrapper object defines method and properties on its prototype

when you use primative values as an object by referencing a property or method,
JS 'boxes' the values to its object wrapper counterpart


there are two main type of value comparison in JS: equality, and inquality
the results of any comparison will be strictly boolean value(true or false),
no matter what kind of values are being compared.

explicit coercion means it is obvious that a value is being converted into
another type,
but implicit coercion is when type conversion happens as more of a non-obvious
side effect of some other operation (42 + 'string' = '42string')

explicit coercion = obvious
implicit coercion = not obvious

when a non-boolean value is coerced into a boolean value is it 'truthy' or
'falsy'?

falsy:
""
0, -0, NaN
null, undefined
false

any other values, when coerced into boolean is 'truthy'
such as, [], 'hello', 42, {}, function() {...}

equality operator: ==, ===, !=, !==

https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/

== checks for value equality with type coercion allowed
=== checks for value equality only(no coercion)

ex.
var a = "42";
var b = 42;

a == b;			// true
a === b;		// false

==
when the types of the values being compared does not match,
it goes through ordered series of steps to coerce on or both values to a
different type until the types match, and then the values are checked.

===
only value checked

avoid == if,
** either value in a comparison could be true of false,
** either value could be 0, [], or ""

inequality: <, >, <=, >=

coercion rules are similar to equality comparison, but not exactly
there is no strict inqeuality comparison like ===

if both values are strings, it is compared alphabetically
but if one or both values are not a string, then the values are coerced into
numbers.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------//

#Variables

variable names must be valid identifiers
-must start with a-z, A-Z, $, _
-can contain the above and 0-9

generally, same apply with property names, but reserved words cannot be used
as variable names: for, in, if, null, true, false, etc

  Function Scopes

use the var keyword to declare a variable to the current function scope,
or the global scope if its is outside of any function.

  Hoisting

Declaration(function, variable) applies to the whole scope, so those
declarations are available anywhere in the correspoding scope.

declarations are conceptually 'moved' to the top of its enclosing scope.

**do not rely on hoisting to use variable earlier than its declaration.
**it is more common for functions to be used earlier.

inner scopes can access outer scopes variables, but not vice versa.

if you set a variable without declaring it, it will automatically be declared
as a global variable(BAD)

ES6 lets you declare variables to belong to individual blocks {...}, using
let keyword.

if blocks, while blocks, for blocks
let keywords lets you contain the scope inside those blocks, unlike var which
lets scope outside of those blocks access the variable.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------//

#Conditionals

if-else

switch statements
-remember to break after each cases, unless you want fall through

ternary operator, conditional operator
(conditional)?(returned value if true):(returned value if false)

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------//

#Strict Mode
strict mode add restrictions which tightens the rules for certain behaviors.
these restrictions are seen as safer, and more appropriate guidelines.

strict mode applies to current scope and inner scopes

ex.
function foo() {
	"use strict";

	// this code is strict mode

	function bar() {
		// this code is strict mode
	}
}

// this code is not strict mode
Compare that to:

"use strict";

function foo() {
	// this code is strict mode

	function bar() {
		// this code is strict mode
	}
}

// this code is strict mode

strict more disallows automatic global declaration for undeclared variables

do not turn of strict mode to fix bugs!

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------//

#Functions as Values

function itself is a value, just like 42, or [1,2,3]
functions can be returned from other functions

**
function foo() {...}

has same outcome as

var foo = function foo() {...}
**

functions are also expressions since they are also values

IIFE

used to create variables that wont affect outside scope

ex.
var a = 42;

(function IIFE(){
	var a = 10;
	console.log( a );	// 10
})();

console.log( a );

can also have a return value

ex.
var x = (function IIFE(){
	return 42;
})();

x;	// 42



closure will the one of the most important techniques in your JS skill set

***
think of closure as a way to "remember" and continue to access a function's
scope (its variables) even after its finished running.

ex.

function makeAdder(x) {

  function add(y) {
    return y+x;
  }

  return add;

}

the returned add function can remember which x was passed in when makerAdder
was called.

// `plusOne` gets a reference to the inner `add(..)`
// function with closure over the `x` parameter of
// the outer `makeAdder(..)`
var plusOne = makeAdder( 1 );

// `plusTen` gets a reference to the inner `add(..)`
// function with closure over the `x` parameter of
// the outer `makeAdder(..)`
var plusTen = makeAdder( 10 );

plusOne( 3 );		// 4  <-- 1 + 3
plusOne( 41 );		// 42 <-- 1 + 41

plusTen( 13 );		// 23 <-- 10 + 13

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------//

#this identifier

If a function has a this reference inside it, that this reference usually points
 to an object. But which object it points to depends on how the function was
 called.

 function foo() {
	console.log( this.bar );
}

var bar = "global";

var obj1 = {
	bar: "obj1",
	foo: foo
};

var obj2 = {
	bar: "obj2"
};

// --------

foo();				// "global"
obj1.foo();			// "obj1"
foo.call( obj2 );	// "obj2"
new foo();			// undefined
There are four rules for how this gets set, and they're shown in those last four
 lines of that snippet.

foo() ends up setting this to the global object in non-strict mode -- in strict
mode, this would be undefined and you'd get an error in accessing the bar
property -- so "global" is the value found for this.bar.
obj1.foo() sets this to the obj1 object.
foo.call(obj2) sets this to the obj2 object.
new foo() sets this to a brand new empty object.
Bottom line: to understand what this points to, you have to examine how the
function in question was called. It will be one of those four ways just shown,
and that will then answer what this is.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------//

The first step to learning JavaScript's flavor of programming is to get a basic
understanding of its core mechanisms like values, types, function closures, this
, and prototypes.
