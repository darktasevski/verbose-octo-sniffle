## Introduction

Redis is an in-memory datastore (i.e.: fast), typically used for
caching. It can distribute through master/slave, and it has some
persistence capability. It appears that it may even have transactions!
It can also be used for pub-sub.

One advantage over memcached is that Redis stores keys to
datatypes. The five provided are:

* STRING
* LIST
* SET
* ZSET (sorted set)
* HASH

Each of these datstructures supports some regular operations.

Commands

* All
    * GET key -> val
    * SET key val
    * DEL key
* List
    * LPUSH/RPUSH key val
    * LPOP/RPOP key -> val
    * LRANGE key low high (fetches a subrange of the list; LRANGE
      my-key 0 -1 gets everything)
    * LINDEX key idx -> val
* SET
    * SADD key val
    * SMEMBERS key -> [vals]
    * SISMEMBER key val -> boolean
    * SREM key val -> boolean (returns whether was member)
* HASH
    * HSET key k v
    * HGET key k -> v
    * HGETALL key -> the whole hash
    * HDEL key k -> boolean
* ZSET
    * ZADD key val score
    * ZRANGE key low high (fetches in some fixed order; insert order I
      think?)
    * ZRANGEBYSCORE key low high (fetches in the score order)
    * ZREM key val

**Example**

Let's build a Reddit system.

Might have a namespace `articles:` which stores a hash of article
properties. We then have a `articles-by-time` and `articles-by-score`
ZSETs; this contains just `article:123456` keys, but sorted by either
(1) creation time or (2) total score.

We'll add a `article-votes:` namespace to keep track of the votes for
article; we'll keep track of the users who have voted for this
article.

In our `upvote_article` function we'll:

1. SADD `article-votes:ARTICLE_ID` USER_ID
2. If not already included, we'll HINCRBY articles:ARTICLE_ID, votes, 1
    * Note this increments a value inside a hash map.
3. We'll ZINCRBY articles-by-score, ARTICLE_ID, 1

In our `post_article` function we'll:

0. INCR article_id to requisition an ARTICLE_ID to use
1. SADD article-votes, ARTICLE_ID, USER_ID
    * Gets one vote from the poster.
    * EXPIRE article-votes, ONE_WEEK
    * This way we won't waste memory recording votes in Redis forever.
2. HMSET articles:ARTICLE_ID { ... }
3. ZADD articles-by-score article, 1
4. ZADD articles-by-time article, now

Our `get_articles` would be like:

0. ZREVRANGE articles-by-score, 0, NUM_PER_PAGE
1. Iterate through article ids:
    * HGETALL article_id

Soon we'll want to start keeping track of articles by group:

```
for group_id in GROUP_IDS:
  SADD group:GROUP_ID, article:ARTICLE_ID
```

But the point is to get results for a group (think: subreddit). To do
this we write `get_group_articles`. We'll need to use an intersection:

    ZINTERSTORE key, [group:GROUP_ID, articles-by-score]

Since this is slow, we'll cache the result under `key =
group-articles-by-score:GROUP_ID`. We'll expire this in 60 sec. We'll
make the reader first check whether the key exists, then possibly
rebuild it.

This sounds suboptimal, because (1) latency, (2) cache stampeding.

Note that this makes sense if articles can be part of many
groups. Otherwise it would have made more sense to just do a `ZINCR
group-articles-by-score:GROUP_ID ARTICLE_ID vote`. Then we wouldn't
need to recalculate this evrey once in a while.

The problem is that if an article can belong to several groups, then
this would take time proportional to the number of groups it is in.

## Whirlwind Tour of Redis Use-Cases

Some uses of Reddit.

**Cookie Caching**

You can use signed cookies, but people think that's hard for some
reason. So instead you can use a cookie token, which is associated
with a session stored server-side. To speed up retrieval of the
session, you can use Redis.

They show an example where we keep a hash of token to user id, and
also a ZSET of user ids by how recently that user visited any page. We
also keep a list of the last 25 pages they've visited. They store this
as a ZSET to make sure it's 25 last unique pages.

We'll keep only the last X million sessions. To garbage collect, we'll
run a chron job every minute, counting the number of sessions. If
there are too many, the wokrer will take about 100 off the end of the
ZSET of recent sessions. They will then remove these keys.

I immediately thought: race condition. You pick someone to delete, but
then they log in! They say don't worry because (1) it's unlikely and
(2) it's a recoverable problem, someone just gets randomly logged
out. They'll also talk about how to avoid race conditions later.

Their claim: without Redis, we would be randomly updating rows
in-place, which is a very slow operation for a database. It's even
worse than just inserting/appending records, which is actually much
faster...

**Shopping Cart**

For `shoping-cart:USER_ID`, we store a hash of ITEM_ID to a quantity.

They mention that now we can do analysis of what people put in a
cart. I say to myself that it would have been better to store this in
a DB or an append-only logfile. But I think what Redis people would
say is: (1) this is way faster and (2) there is some persistence, even
if it isn't ironclad, and that's okay here. This isn't vital data: for
the purposes of analysis, we can lose some data. The speed gain
justifies it without comprimising a critical operation.

**Web Page Caching**

Most content changes infrequently. So we can add a middleware to cache
such content in Redis to avoid re-rendering. We can of course set long
expiration dates, like we do for assets. But some mostly static pages
may only be viewed once by a user, in which case the Cache-Control
header doesn't matter. And what if we do want to bust the cache
sometimes when things change?

We can combine techniques; maybe we should use a Cache-Control of 5min
or so in addition to the page caching by Redis.

**Database Result Caching**

BTW: Redis doesn't allow nested structures. You can just build a more
multipart key, though.

They suggest a zset of row ids called `delay-between-row-updates`,
where the delay is how frequently you'll want to update this row in
the cache. You'll also have a `rows-to-update` zset, which contains
row ids, sorted by when the next update should happen.

A worker extracts the first N rows to update. If it's not time to
update, sleep and repeat. If it's time to update this row, fetch it
from the DB and store it in Redis. Then add it back in
`rows-to-update`, but with the appropriate delay now added.

One nice thing with this approach is that the user always has a needed
row readily available. The update happens in the background, and the
user never waits.

**Analytics**

A lot of analytics tracking can happen in Redis, rather than recording
events into a DB unnecessarily. An example is keeping track of how
frequently pages are viewed.

We can even use this in real-time, where only the most popular pages
remain cached. On every pageview, we increment a counter of number of
times viewed; we keep a zset. Before caching a page, we check if this
is amongst the top N thousand pages; else we won't cache it. This is
what the ZRANK command does.

## More Commands

**Strings**

For numbers:

* INCR/INCRBY/INCRBYFLOAT
* DECR/DECRBY

If the key doesn't exist, Redis treats this like zero. If it does but
can be interpreted as an integer/float, it treats it like
that. Otherwise, if it's a string that clearly isn't a number, it
gives an error. Great.

For strings:

Really just byte arrays.

* APPEND
* GETRANGE/SETRANGE
* GETBIT/SETBIT
* BITCOUNT (counts number of ones)
* BITOP AND, BITOP OR, BITOP XOR, BITOP NOT

**Lists**

* RPUSH/LPUSH
* RPOP/LPOP
* LINDEX
* LRANGE
* LTRIM (== splice)

Some weird ones:

* BLPOP/BRPOP
    * You give a list of keys; this blocks until it can pop an item
      from at least one of them.
    * You specify a timeout too.
* RPOPLPUSH
    * Pops from one list, pushes to another list. Does it atomically I
      assume.
* BRPOPLPUSH
    * Similar: blocks.

They say these are commonly used operations for doing a message or
task queue type thing inside Redis.

**Sets**

* SADD/SREM
* SISMEMBER
* SCARD (element count)
* SMEMBERS
* SRANDMEMBER
* SPOP (removes random item from set)
* SMOVE (atomically moves a specified item from one set to another).

* SDIFF/SDIFFSTORE
* SINTER/SINTERSTORE
* SUNION/SUNIONSTORE

The store versions store the result at a key.

**Hashes**

* HMGET/HMSET/HDEL
* HLEN
* HEXISTS (tests whether a key exists)
* HKEYS/HVALS
* HGETALL (dumps the whole thing)
* HINCRBY/HINCRBYFLOAT (accesses inside a HM)

Note: you can't nest anyway inside a HM; so it's not like there's much
you can do in-place to elements.

**Zset**

* ZADD/ZREM/ZCARD
* ZINCRBY (increments the score)
* ZCOUNT (gets number of elements with score between min and max)
* ZRANK/ZREVRANK (gives position of member)
* ZSCORE (gives score of member)
* ZRANGE/ZREVRANGE (gets a range by ranks; add WITHSCORES to get scores too)

But you also have:

* ZRANGEBYSCORE/ZREVRANGEBYSCORE (gets a range of scores)
* ZREMRANGEBYRANK/ZREMRANGEBYSCORE (removes a range of elements)
* ZINTERSTORE/ZUNIONSTORE
    * Options `AGGREGATE SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX` are needed in case the
      same key is in both sets.

**Publish/Subscribe**

* SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE (by channel name)
* PUBLISH channel message
* PSUBSCRIBE/PUNSUBSCRIBE (by a channel name *pattern*)

In client code, you would allocate an object that would be managing
the subscription. You would start listening to that object; maybe a
thread would do a blocking listen, or you would check in on it every
once in a while. But these operations stream updates down to your
client.

This is not the most widely used feature of Redis:

* Redis used to queue the messages serverside if the client wasn't
  reading, which meant that Redis could easily run out of memory.
    * Probably a great attack vector...
* Also, Redis doesn't care if you lose a message; if the connection is
  broken for some reason, you won't get that message when you
  resubscribe.

**Sort**

`SORT` has a bunch of options. Too many to list here. You can sort
into a source destination.

**Transactions**

`MULTI` starts a transaction, `EXEC` ends it. No ability to
rollback. I think that you basically stop Redis from processing anyone
else's transactions simultaneously? This isn't a huge problem, since
it executes nothing until you `EXEC`. It sounds like `MULTI`/`EXEC` is
relatively efficient, because of the buffering of your commands. Also,
this reduces the back-and-forth communication with the server

**Key Expiration**

* PERSIST (removes any expiration)
* EXPIRE/PEXPIRE (expire in a given number of secs)
* TTL (how long until expiration)
* EXPIREAT/PEXPIREAT (specify a time at which to expire)

The "P" versions use millisecond granularity.

## Persistence

Redis does snapshotting, or logging to an append-only-file. Redis will
try to take a snapshot before quitting, but obviously you can't ensure
that you won't lose data if Redis fails. Snapshots typically occur in
the background. You can configure Redis to take a snapshot every N
seconds. He talks about how a foreground save can be much
faster. Regardless, with just snapshoting you could suffer significant
data loss (especially because Redis snapshots do not include any data
that is inserted between the start of the snapshot and its
completion).

AOF gives you different sync options: on every write, every second, or
just whenever the OS feels like it. As I recall, a lot of people got
upset about not understanding this feature. They mention that always
writing is going to significantly degrade performance; they suggest
hundreds of IOPS on rotational disk, and tens of thousands for
SSD. But they also mention that on SSD you'll have a lot of write
amplification problems.

You can compact the AOF. A typical choice is to do this whenever it
has grown by 100% of the size after the last compaction.

**Replication**

Acheives redundancy, also allows read load to be distributed. As an
example, it takes Redis about 10ms to do a union of two 10k element
sets. Therefore it can only do at most 100 of these per
second. Hopefully that gives some intuition.

You initially startup a follower with a snapshot, and then writes are
streamed from leader. You can actually have a chain of
leaders/followers; this means that the leader can stream updates to a
few followers, who then can use more bandwidth in streaming updates
to still more machines.

With the typical leader/follower setup, you're responsible for manual
failover. Also: I bet bad things happen if the master appears to fail,
but people keep writing to it anyway. You'd be chosing availability
here...

Apparently Redis Sentinel does some kind of automatic failover; they
talk about it in a later chapter.

**Transactions**

We mentioned MULTI/EXEC. We talked about how it can be hard to use
because nothing gets executed until EXEC, so you can't really have any
logic in the middle of your transaction using intermediate results. We
did talk about how this "pipelining" improved performance by giving
Redis all the commands in one go, thus reducing network round-trips.

Recall that transactionality of MULTI/EXEC is acheived because no-one
else can do anything simultaneously. I think Redis is single-threaded,
so that makes sense.

It looks like WATCH is used like this. You can start WATCHing a
key. You probably fetch this key, and do some logic. Then you start a
transaction with MULTI. When the EXEC hits, Redis will see if any
WATCHed keys were modified since the start; if so, then it will fail
the transaction. Otherwise it finishes it.

You can UNWATCH if you realize you won't do a MULTI/EXEC at
all. That's kinda like a ROLLBACK in SQL.

This is basically a form of optimistic concurrency control.

BTW: you can still do pipelining without using transactions. Again,
this matters when commands are issued from a machine which has high
latency to the Redis server.
